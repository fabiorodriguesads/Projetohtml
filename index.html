    <h3 id="oqueehtml">  O que é html?</h3>

    <p>Podemos dizer que o html é uma forma de se escrever as informações que são mostradas para as pessoas quando as mesmas acessam seus navegadores, através de computadores, tablets, ou celulares.
Antes do HTML, a web era apenas um amontoado de documentos de texto sem formatação. O surgimento do HTML foi um marco que possibilitou a estruturação e organização do conteúdo, tornando a web mais acessível e amigável aos usuários.
 A primeira versão do HTML foi lançada em 1991 por <mark> Tim Berners-Lee   </mark>, um cientista da computação britânico, e desde então, o HTML evoluiu através de várias versões.<a href title="#clique-aqui-para-voltar"><button>Voltar</button></a></p> 

<h3 id="oquesaotags"> O que são tags? </h3>

<p> As "tags" no HTML são elementos fundamentais que permitem a marcação e estruturação do conteúdo em uma página da web. Elas são como etiquetas que envolvem o texto, imagens, links e outros elementos, fornecendo informações ao navegador sobre como exibir e interpretar cada parte do conteúdo
    Em resumo, as tags no HTML são essenciais para estruturar e apresentar o conteúdo de uma página da web de forma organizada e significativa para os navegadores e, assim, para os visitantes do site.<a href title="#clique-aqui-para-voltar"><button>Voltar</button></a>
</p>

<h3 id="o-que-sao-atributos"> O que são atributos? </h3>

<p> Em HTML, os "atributos" são elementos que fornecem informações adicionais ou configurações específicas para as tags. Eles são usados para modificar o comportamento ou a aparência dos elementos HTML, dando mais detalhes sobre como esses elementos devem ser exibidos ou funcionar na página da web.

    Os atributos são adicionados diretamente nas tags HTML e são compostos por um nome e um valor, separados por um sinal de igual ("="). O valor do atributo é colocado entre aspas, seja aspas duplas ou simples.
    
    Um exemplo comum de atributo é o "href" usado na tag de âncora "<a>". O atributo "href" especifica o link de destino para onde o usuário será redirecionado quando clicar no link. Por exemplo:
    <a href title="#clique-aqui-para-voltar"><button>Voltar</button></a>
</p>
